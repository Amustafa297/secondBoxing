                <h2>About Material </h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p> Glove<span style="color: red;">Box</span> has developed a leather type glove which has a high-tech
                    components
                    that make your hand super safe and the gloves super durable. We use light materials such as kevlar
                    for high strength and
                    because it is a light and durable material. Our two major components that are used are carbon fiber
                    and memory foam. The carbon fiber is strong and it is
                    heat-resistant material so in that way it keeps your hands nice and cooled. The memory foam is used
                    to create the shape of the wearer's hand for the custom fit
                    and improved shock absorption.
                    These materials can be combined to create a lightweight and highly protective glove, with better
                    shock absorption and a custom fit. </p>
